| CRITICAL | CVE-2023-6879 | Increasing the resolution of video frames, while performing a multi-threaded encode, can result in a heap overflow in av1_loop_restoration_dealloc().\n\n | libaom3 |
| CRITICAL | CVE-2024-38428 | url.c in GNU Wget through 1.24.5 mishandles semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, and thus there may be insecure behavior in which data that was supposed to be in the userinfo subcomponent is misinterpreted to be part of the host subcomponent. | wget |
| HIGH | CVE-2013-7445 | The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.x mishandles requests for Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) objects, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an application that processes graphics data, as demonstrated by JavaScript code that creates many CANVAS elements for rendering by Chrome or Firefox. | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2019-19449 | In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in f2fs_build_segment_manager in fs/f2fs/segment.c, related to init_min_max_mtime in fs/f2fs/segment.c (because the second argument to get_seg_entry is not validated). | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2019-19814 | In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image can cause __remove_dirty_segment slab-out-of-bounds write access because an array is bounded by the number of dirty types (8) but the array index can exceed this. | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2021-3847 | An unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities flaw in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way user copying a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2021-3864 | A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges. | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2023-52452 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots\n\nPrivileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack\nmemory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses\nwere permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already "large enough", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to "grow the\nstack". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv. | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2023-52590 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: Avoid touching renamed directory if parent does not change\n\nThe VFS will not be locking moved directory if its parent does not\nchange. Change ocfs2 rename code to avoid touching renamed directory if\nits parent does not change as without locking that can corrupt the\nfilesystem. | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-26669 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm "tc", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm "tc", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated--- | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-36899 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify\n\nThe use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file\nis being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed\nby bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier\nchain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO\nchip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's\nread rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of\nwatched_lines.\n\nHere is the typical stack when issue happened:\n\n[free]\ngpio_chrdev_release()\n  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed\n  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()\n    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem\n          --> __down_write_common()\n            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()\n                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()\n                    --> schedule()\n\n[use]\nst54spi_gpio_dev_release()\n  --> gpio_free()\n    --> gpiod_free()\n      --> gpiod_free_commit()\n        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()\n          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()\n            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem\n            --> notifier_call_chain()\n              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()\n                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free\n\nThe side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is\nbeing generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev\nis being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.\n\nTo fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration\nof lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain. | linux-libc-dev |
| HIGH | CVE-2024-38570 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount\n\nWhen a DLM lockspace is released and there ares still locks in that\nlockspace, DLM will unlock those locks automatically.  Commit\nfb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem\nunmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then\nrelease the lockspace.  This didn't take the bast callbacks for\nasynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain\nactive until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released.\n\nTo prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the\nglocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release\nthe lockspace, and only then free those glocks.\n\nAs an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if\nthe receiving glock is dead. | linux-libc-dev |

However, in i915 there are two separate code\npaths, which both release either drvdata or hwmon and either can be\nreleased before the other. These code paths (for device unbind) are as\nfollows (see also the bug referenced below):\n\nCall Trace:\nrelease_nodes+0x11/0x70\ndevres_release_group+0xb2/0x110\ncomponent_unbind_all+0x8d/0xa0\ncomponent_del+0xa5/0x140\nintel_pxp_tee_component_fini+0x29/0x40 [i915]\nintel_pxp_fini+0x33/0x80 [i915]\ni915_driver_remove+0x4c/0x120 [i915]\ni915_pci_remove+0x19/0x30 [i915]\npci_device_remove+0x32/0xa0\ndevice_release_driver_internal+0x19c/0x200\nunbind_store+0x9c/0xb0\n\nand\n\nCall Trace:\nrelease_nodes+0x11/0x70\ndevres_release_all+0x8a/0xc0\ndevice_unbind_cleanup+0x9/0x70\ndevice_release_driver_internal+0x1c1/0x200\nunbind_store+0x9c/0xb0\n\nThis means that in i915, if use devm, we cannot gurantee that hwmon will\nalways be released before drvdata. Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon\nsysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.\n\nThe only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free\neverything explicitly during device unbind.\n\nv2: Change commit message and other minor code changes\nv3: Cleanup from i915_hwmon_register on error (Armin Wolf)\nv4: Eliminate potential static analyzer warning (Rodrigo)\n    Eliminate fetch_and_zero (Jani)\nv5: Restore previous logic for ddat_gt->hwmon_dev error return (Andi) | linux-libc-dev |

We may\nencounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.\n\nIn the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold\nan unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and\nxfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make\nsure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a\nsingle-byte name before accessing xfs_dir2_data_entry. | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-50063 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses. | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-50164 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning\n\nLonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()\nhas the following code:\n\n    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))\n        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw\n         * mode so that the program is required to\n         * initialize all the memory that the helper could\n         * just partially fill up.\n         */\n         meta = NULL;\n\nThis means that writes are not checked when the register containing the\nsize of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF\nprogram can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,\n.rodata global maps.\n\nThe problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that "the passed buffer\nto the BPF helper does not need to be initialized" which was added back\nin commit 435faee1aae9 ("bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type")\ngot overloaded over time with "the passed buffer is being written to".\n\nThe problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later\nvia 06c1c049721a ("bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory") set meta\nto NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to\nthe helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses\nverifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only\nassumes the latter memory is read instead.\n\nFix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having\nMEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the\nBPF verifier checks for writing to memory.\n\nSome notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}\nwe can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding\nARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed\naltogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the\nequivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg(). | linux-libc-dev |

The effect though\nis that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and\nreferencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit.

This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper\nsequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the\nrisk of use-after-free errors in sg_release(). | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-56759 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled\n\nWhen a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the\ntracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled\n(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent\nbuffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there. | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2024-57892 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv\n\nWhen mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a\nslab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to\nquota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups] | linux-libc-dev |

| HIGH | CVE-2025-21647 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts\n\nEven though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot\nstill managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow\ncounters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.\n\nTo avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,\nthis commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters\nto a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any\nincrements and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving\nreadability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into\nthese helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the\ncode (which was the cause of the original logic error).\n\nAs part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated\ninto a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the\nost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a\nsparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should\nnot make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth\ncomplicating the code to preserve the old behaviour. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2023-52625 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface\n\n[Why]\nWe can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't\npowered on.\n\n[How]\nWe need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,\nbut the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.\n\nFixing this issue involves the following:\n\n1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start\n   the process to exit idle or notify idle.\n\nIt's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without\ndriver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver\nallow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one\nof optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.\n\n2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper\n   that maintains this SW state.\n\nThis works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the\nDMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit\nidle so we don't enter an infinite loop.\n\n3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or\n   waiting for DMCUB idle.\n\nThis patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping\nDMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface. | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2023-52629 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug\n\nThe original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()\nin switch_drv_remove().

The arithmetic\nimplies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The\nregister was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not\nwhen it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which\ncase it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller\nchecked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a\nkfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being\ninconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an\nu32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were\ncurrently used for arithmetic.\n\n[1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L7494-L7498\n[2] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L11904 | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2023-52761 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: VMAP_STACK overflow detection thread-safe\n\ncommit 31da94c25aea ("riscv: add VMAP_STACK overflow detection") added\nsupport for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK. If overflow is detected, CPU switches to\n`shadow_stack` temporarily before switching finally to per-cpu\n`overflow_stack`.\n\nIf two CPUs/harts are racing and end up in over flowing kernel stack, one\nor both will end up corrupting each other state because `shadow_stack` is\nnot per-cpu. This patch optimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by\ndirectly picking per-cpu `overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`.\n\nFollowing are the changes in this patch\n\n - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols in destination\n   register.\n - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpu overflow stack is\n   located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbol requires\n   a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH\n   (CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel).\n\nPlease see Links for additional relevant disccussion and alternative\nsolution.\n\nTested by `echo EXHAUST_STACK > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT`\nKernel crash log below\n\n Insufficient stack space to handle exception!/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT\n Task stack:     [0xff20000010a98000..0xff20000010a9c000]\n Overflow stack: [0xff600001f7d98370..0xff600001f7d99370]\n CPU: 1 PID: 205 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.1.0-rc2-00001-g328a1f96f7b9 #34\n Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)\n epc : __memset+0x60/0xfc\n  ra : recursive_loop+0x48/0xc6 [lkdtm]\n epc : ffffffff808de0e4 ra : ffffffff0163a752 sp : ff20000010a97e80\n  gp : ffffffff815c0330 tp : ff600000820ea280 t0 : ff20000010a97e88\n  t1 : 000000000000002e t2 : 3233206874706564 s0 : ff20000010a982b0\n  s1 : 0000000000000012 a0 : ff20000010a97e88 a1 : 0000000000000000\n  a2 : 0000000000000400 a3 : ff20000010a98288 a4 : 0000000000000000\n  a5 : 0000000000000000 a6 : fffffffffffe43f0 a7 : 00007fffffffffff\n  s2 : ff20000010a97e88 s3 : ffffffff01644680 s4 : ff20000010a9be90\n  s5 : ff600000842ba6c0 s6 : 00aaaaaac29e42b0 s7 : 00fffffff0aa3684\n  s8 : 00aaaaaac2978040 s9 : 0000000000000065 s10: 00ffffff8a7cad10\n  s11: 00ffffff8a76a4e0 t3 : ffffffff815dbaf4 t4 : ffffffff815dbaf4\n  t5 : ffffffff815dbab8 t6 : ff20000010a9bb48\n status: 0000000200000120 badaddr: ff20000010a97e88 cause: 000000000000000f\n Kernel panic - not syncing: Kernel stack overflow\n CPU: 1 PID: 205 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.1.0-rc2-00001-g328a1f96f7b9 #34\n Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)\n Call Trace:\n [<ffffffff80006754>] dump_backtrace+0x30/0x38\n [<ffffffff808de798>] show_stack+0x40/0x4c\n [<ffffffff808ea2a8>] dump_stack_lvl+0x44/0x5c\n [<ffffffff808ea2d8>] dump_stack+0x18/0x20\n [<ffffffff808dec06>] panic+0x126/0x2fe\n [<ffffffff800065ea>] walk_stackframe+0x0/0xf0\n [<ffffffff0163a752>] recursive_loop+0x48/0xc6 [lkdtm]\n SMP: stopping secondary CPUs\n ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Kernel stack overflow ]--- | linux-libc-dev |

We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/ | linux-libc-dev |

A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including\n|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.\n|\n| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.\n\nThe important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed "after all\nexplicit memory accesses".\n\nUnfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by\nan LDR, as we have:\n\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n| \teret\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n|\n| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n\nThis patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB\nimmediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.\n\nThe ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives\ncannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for\nARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch\nto skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:\n\n| alternative_insn "b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \t[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@:\n|\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n|\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| \teret\n\nThe new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is\nnot in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the\nerratum:\n\n| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the\n| issue from occurring.\n\n... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround\nis only necessary "If pagetable isolation is disabled". | linux-libc-dev |

Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let\nthe remainder cpus stay in BIOS.\n\nThe potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can\nbe overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC\nshould be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it\nis better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].\n\nWith the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,\notherwise system will crash with the following message.\n\n[    0.000000] CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000420000004259, era == 90000000037a5f0c, ra == 90000000037a46ec\n[    0.000000] Oops[#1]:\n[    0.000000] CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.8.0-rc2+ #192\n[    0.000000] Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown 2/2/2022\n[    0.000000] pc 90000000037a5f0c ra 90000000037a46ec tp 9000000003c90000 sp 9000000003c93d60\n[    0.000000] a0 0000000000000019 a1 9000000003d93bc0 a2 0000000000000000 a3 9000000003c93bd8\n[    0.000000] a4 9000000003c93a74 a5 9000000083c93a67 a6 9000000003c938f0 a7 0000000000000005\n[    0.000000] t0 0000420000004201 t1 0000000000000000 t2 0000000000000001 t3 0000000000000001\n[    0.000000] t4 0000000000000003 t5 0000000000000000 t6 0000000000000030 t7 0000000000000063\n[    0.000000] t8 0000000000000014 u0 ffffffffffffffff s9 0000000000000000 s0 9000000003caee98\n[    0.000000] s1 90000000041b0480 s2 9000000003c93da0 s3 9000000003c93d98 s4 9000000003c93d90\n[    0.000000] s5 9000000003caa000 s6 000000000a7fd000 s7 000000000f556b60 s8 000000000e0a4330\n[    0.000000]    ra: 90000000037a46ec platform_init+0x214/0x250\n[    0.000000]   ERA: 90000000037a5f0c efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94\n[    0.000000]  CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)\n[    0.000000]  PRMD: 00000000 (PPLV0 -PIE -PWE)\n[    0.000000]  EUEN: 00000000 (-FPE -SXE -ASXE -BTE)\n[    0.000000]  ECFG: 00070800 (LIE=11 VS=7)\n[    0.000000] ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)\n[    0.000000]  BADV: 0000420000004259\n[    0.000000]  PRID: 0014c010 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3A5000)\n[    0.000000] Modules linked in:\n[    0.000000] Process swapper (pid: 0, threadinfo=(____ptrval____), task=(____ptrval____))\n[    0.000000] Stack : 9000000003c93a14 9000000003800898 90000000041844f8 90000000037a46ec\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 0000000008290000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\n[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000019d8000 000000000f556b60\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08 9000000003ca7700 9000000003800000\n[    0.000000]         9000000003c93e50 9000000003800898 9000000003800108 90000000037a484c\n[    0.000000]         000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08\n[    0.000000]         9000000003ca7700 9000000004184000 0000000000200000 000000000e02b018\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 90000000037a0790 9000000003800108 0000000000000000\n[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000\n[    0.000000]         000000000f556b08 000000000eaae298 000000000eaa5040 0000000000200000\n[    0.000000]         ...\n[    0.000000] Call Trace:\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a5f0c>] efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a46ec>] platform_init+0x214/0x250\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a484c>] setup_arch+0x124/0x45c\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a0790>] start_kernel+0x90/0x670\n[    0.000000] [<900000000378b0d8>] kernel_entry+0xd8/0xdc | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-26807 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBoth cadence-quadspi ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume()\nimplementations start with:\n\n\tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nThis obviously cannot be correct, unless "struct cqspi_st" is the\nfirst member of " struct spi_controller", or the other way around, but\nit is not the case. "struct spi_controller" is allocated by\ndevm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory for\nprivate data, used to store "struct cqspi_st".\n\nThe ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the\ndevice drvdata to store the address of the "struct cqspi_st"\nstructure. Therefore:\n\n\tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis correct, but:\n\n\tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis not, as it makes "host" point not to a "struct spi_controller" but\nto the same "struct cqspi_st" structure as above.\n\nThis obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)\ndirectly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM\nruntime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in\nturns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.\n\nThis has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the\nexact behavior will depend on the memory contents.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/\n\nThis issue potentially affects all platforms that are currently using\nthe cadence-quadspi driver. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-26982 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: check the inode number is not the invalid value of zero\n\nSyskiller has produced an out of bounds access in fill_meta_index().\n\nThat out of bounds access is ultimately caused because the inode\nhas an inode number with the invalid value of zero, which was not checked.\n\nThe reason this causes the out of bounds access is due to following\nsequence of events:\n\n1. Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-27005 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninterconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated\n\nThe icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock\nmutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately\nprotect access to icc_node::req_list.\n\nThe icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while\nonly holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while only\nholding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),\nand icc_put().\n\nExample A:\n\n  CPU0                               CPU1\n  ----                               ----\n  icc_set_bw(path_a)\n    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);\n                                     icc_put(path_b)\n                                       mutex_lock(&icc_lock);\n    aggregate_requests()\n      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...\n                                       hlist_del(...\n        <r = invalid pointer>\n\nExample B:\n\n  CPU0                               CPU1\n  ----                               ----\n  icc_set_bw(path_a)\n    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);\n                                     path_b = of_icc_get()\n                                       of_icc_get_by_index()\n                                         mutex_lock(&icc_lock);\n                                         path_find()\n                                           path_init()\n    aggregate_requests()\n      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...\n                                             hlist_add_head(...\n        <r = invalid pointer>\n\nFix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating\nicc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't\nperform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from the\noriginal lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.\n\n[1] commit af42269c3523 ("interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim") | linux-libc-dev |

The existing set iterator skips inactive\nelements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path\nto restore the original state since it has to skip active elements\ninstead (not inactive ones).\n\nThis patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator\ncallback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which\nneeds to skip active elements.\n\nToggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is\ninvoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the\nnext generation bit.\n\nThe splat below shows an object in mappings memleak:\n\n[43929.457523] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[43929.457532] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1139 at include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1237 nft_setelem_data_deactivate+0xe4/0xf0 [nf_tables]\n[...]\n[43929.458014] RIP: 0010:nft_setelem_data_deactivate+0xe4/0xf0 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458076] Code: 83 f8 01 77 ab 49 8d 7c 24 08 e8 37 5e d0 de 49 8b 6c 24 08 48 8d 7d 50 e8 e9 5c d0 de 8b 45 50 8d 50 ff 89 55 50 85 c0 75 86 <0f> 0b eb 82 0f 0b eb b3 0f 1f 40 00 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90\n[43929.458081] RSP: 0018:ffff888140f9f4b0 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[43929.458086] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8881434f5288 RCX: dffffc0000000000\n[43929.458090] RDX: 00000000ffffffff RSI: ffffffffa26d28a7 RDI: ffff88810ecc9550\n[43929.458093] RBP: ffff88810ecc9500 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffffed10281f3e8f\n[43929.458096] R10: 0000000000000003 R11: ffff0000ffff0000 R12: ffff8881434f52a0\n[43929.458100] R13: ffff888140f9f5f4 R14: ffff888151c7a800 R15: 0000000000000002\n[43929.458103] FS:  00007f0c687c4740(0000) GS:ffff888390800000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[43929.458107] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[43929.458111] CR2: 00007f58dbe5b008 CR3: 0000000123602005 CR4: 00000000001706f0\n[43929.458114] Call Trace:\n[43929.458118]  <TASK>\n[43929.458121]  ? __warn+0x9f/0x1a0\n[43929.458127]  ? nft_setelem_data_deactivate+0xe4/0xf0 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458188]  ? report_bug+0x1b1/0x1e0\n[43929.458196]  ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n[43929.458200]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x40\n[43929.458211]  ? nft_setelem_data_deactivate+0xd7/0xf0 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458271]  ? nft_setelem_data_deactivate+0xe4/0xf0 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458332]  nft_mapelem_deactivate+0x24/0x30 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458392]  nft_rhash_walk+0xdd/0x180 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458453]  ? __pfx_nft_rhash_walk+0x10/0x10 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458512]  ? rb_insert_color+0x2e/0x280\n[43929.458520]  nft_map_deactivate+0xdc/0x1e0 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458582]  ? __pfx_nft_map_deactivate+0x10/0x10 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458642]  ? __pfx_nft_mapelem_deactivate+0x10/0x10 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458701]  ? __rcu_read_unlock+0x46/0x70\n[43929.458709]  nft_delset+0xff/0x110 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458769]  nft_flush_table+0x16f/0x460 [nf_tables]\n[43929.458830]  nf_tables_deltable+0x501/0x580 [nf_tables] | linux-libc-dev |

This is safe in general because we keep track of where we\nare when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in\nthe middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents\nbecause we know what offset we were on before.\n\nThe only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the\ndelalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent\nrange so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're\nchecking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.\n\nWith this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-35794 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend\n\n1) commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread") remove\n   MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from __md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that\n   dm-raid relies on __md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread\n   indirectly. Fix this problem by adding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in\n   md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread() is only used for\n   dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() to\n   md_stop_writes().\n2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that sync thread is frozen,\n   it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can't stop the\n   running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after seting the\n   flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used.\n3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that writes are stopped, use\n   it as condition for md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't\n   look correct. Consider that reentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing,\n   always call md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend().\n4) raid_message can set/clear the flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime,\n   and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared while the array is suspended,\n   new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this by disallow\n   raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend.\n\nNote that after commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread"), the\ntest shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(),\nand with previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the\ntest will still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this\npatch, the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4\nis corrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to\ndm-raid456 that will be fixed in following patches. | linux-libc-dev |

Theoretically, a device could be released\nby the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before\niopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.\n\nAdd a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU\nrelease device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,\nas the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is\nvery rare. | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-35860 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period\n\nBPF link for some program types is passed as a "context" which can be\nused by those BPF programs to look up additional information. E.g., for\nmulti-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.\n\nBecause of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero\nthere could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.\n\nThis patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to\nafter RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different\ndeallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred\none is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()\ncallback to happen after RCU GP.\n\nBPF is using two flavors of RCU: "classic" non-sleepable one and RCU\ntasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are\nused. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF\nprogram's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for\nnon-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP\n(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF\nprogram is sleepable.\n\nWe use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference\nlink during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use\ndeferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose\nraw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime\nas well. | linux-libc-dev |

So it's better if we can 100%\nguarantee no uffd-wp bit leftovers, to make sure each report will be\nvalid. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-41045 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free\n\nCurrently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying\nto cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as\nwell, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since\nthis relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock\nsituation as the previous patch.\n\nIt would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,\nas the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once\nasync_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized\nbefore it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\n\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\n\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\n\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs. | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-41067 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly\n\n[BUG]\nWhen running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the\nfollowing ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():\n\n\tASSERT(sector_nr < stripe->nr_sectors);\n\nBefore that, we would have tree dump from\nbtrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for\nthe range.\n\n[CAUSE]\nInside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new\nbbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some\nRST range covering the scrub target.\n\nBut if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,\nwhile the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.\n\nThen inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find\nthe sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is\nsubmitted to lower layers).\n\nAnd since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any\nsector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe->nr_sectors,\ntriggering the ASSERT().\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call\nbtrfs_map_block() first.\n\nSince our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update\nstripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().\n\nThis new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio\ncompletely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,\nwhere if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the\nscrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io\ncounter).\n\nAlthough the root cause of RST lookup failure still needs to be\naddressed. | linux-libc-dev |

If\na reset (nvme reset or IO timeout) occurs before these commands finish,\nreconnect routine may fail to update nvme regs due to insufficient tags,\nwhich will cause kernel hang forever.

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-42239 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled\n\nGiven a schedule:\n\ntimer1 cb\t\t\ttimer2 cb\n\nbpf_timer_cancel(timer2);\tbpf_timer_cancel(timer1);\n\nBoth bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish\nexecuting, introducing a lockup.\n\nAdd an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps\ntrack of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.\nWhenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding\ncancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an\nerror (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the\ncallback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock\nsituation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel\nand attempting to cancel one another.\n\nNote that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target\ntimer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from\na callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting\ncur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop\n(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the\ncaller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to\ncancel as it sees fit without running into errors.\n\nBackground on prior attempts:\n\nEarlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the\nfollowing pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.\n\nlock(t->lock);\nt->cancelling = true;\nmb();\nif (cur->cancelling)\n\treturn -EDEADLK;\nunlock(t->lock);\nhrtimer_cancel(t->timer);\nt->cancelling = false;\n\nThe store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel\nrequests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely\nexecuting callback observes its cancellation status.\n\nIt would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel\nis done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was\nexplored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the\ntimer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the\ncancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight\nhrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur\nagain.\n\nThus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding\ncancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks\nattempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel. | linux-libc-dev |

The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a\ncomment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,\nbecause in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned\nfrom btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back to\nbtrfs_free_tree_block().\n\nSo stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and make\nthem abort the transaction to prevent leaking space.

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-46787 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDs\n\nPatch series "userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check", v2.\n\nThe pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different\nways depending on kernel version:\n\n1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit\n   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with\n   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description\n   of the race scenario.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even\n   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table\n   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).\n2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for\n   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly\n   wide race to hit this.\n   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()\n   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86\n   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().\n3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed\n   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),\n   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.\n\nI decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one\nfix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels\naffected by bugs 1+2.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThis fixes two issues.\n\nI discovered that the following race can occur:\n\n  mfill_atomic                other thread\n  ============                ============\n                              <zap PMD>\n  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]\n  <bail if trans_huge>\n  <if none:>\n                              <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>\n    __pte_alloc [no-op]\n                              <zap PMD>\n  <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>\n  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))\n\nI have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;\nthe BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.\n\nOn kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b ("mm/pgtable: allow\npte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail"), this can't lead to anything worse than\na BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to\ndeal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels\n(<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two\nBUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.\n\nThe second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types\nof huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs\n(in particular, migration PMDs).\n\nOn <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a\nPMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,\nfairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which\nassumes that the PMD points to a page table.\n\nBreakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will\ncrash or maybe worse if there is no "struct page" for the address bits in\nthe migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no\ncorresponding "struct page" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64\nlooks different).\n\nIf that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what\nit wrongly thinks is a page table.\n\nAs part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()\nbefore __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for\nthat after the __pte_alloc() anyway.\n\nBackport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-46842 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info\n\nThe MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the\nroutine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of\nreturn status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware\nreturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region\nreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.\n\nFix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox\nresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not\ntimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-47736 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly\n\nsyzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is\nwaiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for\ncache I/Os.\n\nAfter looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed with\nseveral overlapped big pclusters as below:\n\n Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length\n   0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384\n   1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384\n   2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384\n...\n\nHere, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely\n_impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.\n\nFirst, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as\nup-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when\ncompressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 ("erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-47794 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace\n\nThere is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a\ncombination of tail calls and freplace.\n\nIn an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of\ntailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in\nentry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:\n\nentry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.\n\nThe problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to\nzero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism\nto never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, the solution is twofold:\n\n1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a\n   prog_array map.\n2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map\n   with an freplace program.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,\n  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.\n* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its\n  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.\n\nMoreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return\n-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a\nprog_array map.\n\nAdditionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a\ntab for proper formatting. | linux-libc-dev |

The null pointer dereference\ncan only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource\nassigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we\nshould be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we\nactually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.\n\nIn this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id\nis enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this\nexists. | linux-libc-dev |

When\nthe session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel\nrefcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is\nset in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented\nby l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where\nsession->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been\nbumped.\n\nMoving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but\nl2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses\nsession->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap.

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-49998 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at "arbitrary runtime" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-> ...\n   -> dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -> ds->ops->phy_read()\n         -> lan9303_phy_read()\n            -> chip->ops->phy_read()\n               -> lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -> dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp->conduit->dsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev->dsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev->dsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds->ops->phy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit->dsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n("net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit->dsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up). | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-53079 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking\n\nRecent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:\nunder load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,\n"Bad page state"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually\ndon't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent\nchanges being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,\nimproved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.\n\nBefore fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),\nwhich does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),\nwhich is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm\ninternals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to\ncheck usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,\nwhich can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing\ncallers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).\n\nJust omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all\nof whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()\nwill tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no\nlonger has any callers (and will be deleted separately).\n\nSwapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0\nwithout checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;\nwhich is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg\n(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,\nwhen freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially\ncorrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0\nhere, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before\nresetting memcg_data.\n\nThat goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 ("mm: thp: make deferred split\nshrinker memcg aware"): which included a check on swapcache before adding\nto deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to\nswapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim\n(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue\ncould have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 ("mm: split\nunderused THPs") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes\nswapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.\n\nKeep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is\nno longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely\nto be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the\nqueue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.\n\nMemcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing\nfolio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the\ndeferred list, sometimes corrupting "from" memcg's list, like swapout. \nRefcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be\nused in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:\nmem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting\nof course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving\ncharge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:\nnobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.\n\nThe 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list\nto another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);\nbut that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 ("mm: thp: don't need care\ndeferred split queue in memcg charge move path"), which argued that the\nexistence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred\nlist.

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-53085 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first\n\nSetting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy\naccording, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while\nthe operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of\nthis behaviour.\n\nAadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags both\nin tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED\ncheck inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when\nthe lock is reserved. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-53095 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.\n\nRecently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while\nreconnecting to a server.  [0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 ("smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

It leaks if returned from\nopen_cached_dir().\n\nFix this by setting cfid->has_lease when the ref is actually taken; the\ncfid will not be used by other threads until it has a valid time.\n\nAddresses these kmemleaks:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881090c4000 (size 1024):\n  comm "bash", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 01 00 00 00 00 ad de 22 01 00 00 00 00 ad de  ........".......\n    00 ca 45 22 81 88 ff ff f8 dc 4f 04 81 88 ff ff  ..E"......O.....\n  backtrace (crc 6f58c20f):\n    [<ffffffff8b895a1e>] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2be/0x350\n    [<ffffffff8bda06e3>] open_cached_dir+0x993/0x1fb0\n    [<ffffffff8bdaa750>] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50\n    [<ffffffff8b9a853f>] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0\n    [<ffffffff8b9a9aed>] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200\n    [<ffffffff8cf6da05>] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0\n    [<ffffffff8d00012f>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881044fdcf8 (size 8):\n  comm "bash", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592\n  hex dump (first 8 bytes):\n    00 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc                          ........\n  backtrace (crc 10c106a9):\n    [<ffffffff8b89a3d3>] __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x363/0x480\n    [<ffffffff8b7d7256>] kstrdup+0x36/0x60\n    [<ffffffff8bda0700>] open_cached_dir+0x9b0/0x1fb0\n    [<ffffffff8bdaa750>] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50\n    [<ffffffff8b9a853f>] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0\n    [<ffffffff8b9a9aed>] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200\n    [<ffffffff8cf6da05>] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0\n    [<ffffffff8d00012f>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nAnd addresses these BUG splats when unmounting the SMB filesystem:\n\nBUG: Dentry ffff888140590ba0{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]\nWARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3433 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xd0/0x100\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 3433 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.12.0-rc4-g850925a8133c-dirty #49\nHardware name: VMware, Inc.

As for now, the maximal read size for kvec iter is\nonly limited by fc->max_read. For virtio-fs, max_read is UINT_MAX, so\nfuse_direct_io() doesn't split the 10MB buffer. It saves the address and\nthe size of the 10MB-sized buffer in out_args[0] of a fuse request and\npasses the fuse request to virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock().\n\n4) virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock() uses virtio_fs_enqueue_req() to\nqueue the request. Because virtiofs need DMA-able address, so\nvirtio_fs_enqueue_req() uses kmalloc() to allocate a bounce buffer for\nall fuse args, copies these args into the bounce buffer and passed the\nphysical address of the bounce buffer to virtiofsd. The total length of\nthese fuse args for the passed fuse request is about 10MB, so\ncopy_args_to_argbuf() invokes kmalloc() with a 10MB size parameter and\nit triggers the warning in __alloc_pages():\n\n\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE_GFP(order > MAX_PAGE_ORDER, gfp))\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\n5) virtio_fs_enqueue_req() will retry the memory allocation in a\nkworker, but it won't help, because kmalloc() will always return NULL\ndue to the abnormal size and finit_module() will hang forever.\n\nA feasible solution is to limit the value of max_read for virtio-fs, so\nthe length passed to kmalloc() will be limited. However it will affect\nthe maximal read size for normal read. And for virtio-fs write initiated\nfrom kernel, it has the similar problem but now there is no way to limit\nfc->max_write in kernel.\n\nSo instead of limiting both the values of max_read and max_write in\nkernel, introducing use_pages_for_kvec_io in fuse_conn and setting it as\ntrue in virtiofs. When use_pages_for_kvec_io is enabled, fuse will use\npages instead of pointer to pass the KVEC_IO data.\n\nAfter switching to pages for KVEC_IO data, these pages will be used for\nDMA through virtio-fs. If these pages are backed by vmalloc(),\n{flush|invalidate}_kernel_vmap_range() are necessary to flush or\ninvalidate the cache before the DMA operation. So add two new fields in\nfuse_args_pages to record the base address of vmalloc area and the\ncondition indicating whether invalidation is needed. Perform the flush\nin fuse_get_user_pages() for write operations and the invalidation in\nfuse_release_user_pages() for read operations.\n\nIt may seem necessary to introduce another fie\n---truncated--- | linux-libc-dev |

Because the slab is neither on the partial list nor\non the full list, it eventually lead to a list corruption (actually a\nlist poison being detected).\n\nSo we need to mark and isolate the slab page with metadata corruption,\ndo not put it back in circulation.\n\nBecause the debug caches avoid all the fastpaths, reusing the frozen bit\nto mark slab page with metadata corruption seems to be fine.\n\n[ 4277.385669] list_del corruption, ffffea00044b3e50->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100)\n[ 4277.387023] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[ 4277.387880] kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!\n[ 4277.388680] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n[ 4277.389562] CPU: 5 PID: 90 Comm: kworker/5:1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G           OE      6.6.1-1 #1\n[ 4277.392113] Workqueue: xfs-inodegc/vda1 xfs_inodegc_worker [xfs]\n[ 4277.393551] RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.394518] Code: 48 91 82 e8 37 f9 9a ff 0f 0b 48 89 fe 48 c7 c7 28 49 91 82 e8 26 f9 9a ff 0f 0b 48 89 fe 48 c7 c7 58 49 91\n[ 4277.397292] RSP: 0018:ffffc90000333b38 EFLAGS: 00010082\n[ 4277.398202] RAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffffea00044b3e50 RCX: 0000000000000000\n[ 4277.399340] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: ffffffff828f8715 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n[ 4277.400545] RBP: ffffea00044b3e40 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffc900003339f0\n[ 4277.401710] R10: 0000000000000003 R11: ffffffff82d44088 R12: ffff888112cf9910\n[ 4277.402887] R13: 0000000000000001 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: ffff8881000424c0\n[ 4277.404049] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88842fd40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[ 4277.405357] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[ 4277.406389] CR2: 00007f2ad0b24000 CR3: 0000000102a3a006 CR4: 00000000007706e0\n[ 4277.407589] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[ 4277.408780] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[ 4277.410000] PKRU: 55555554\n[ 4277.410645] Call Trace:\n[ 4277.411234]  <TASK>\n[ 4277.411777]  ? die+0x32/0x80\n[ 4277.412439]  ? do_trap+0xd6/0x100\n[ 4277.413150]  ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.414158]  ? do_error_trap+0x6a/0x90\n[ 4277.414948]  ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.415915]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x4c/0x60\n[ 4277.416710]  ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.417675]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n[ 4277.418482]  ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.419466]  ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x7b/0xc0\n[ 4277.420410]  free_to_partial_list+0x515/0x5e0\n[ 4277.421242]  ? xfs_iext_remove+0x41a/0xa10 [xfs]\n[ 4277.422298]  xfs_iext_remove+0x41a/0xa10 [xfs]\n[ 4277.423316]  ? xfs_inodegc_worker+0xb4/0x1a0 [xfs]\n[ 4277.424383]  xfs_bmap_del_extent_delay+0x4fe/0x7d0 [xfs]\n[ 4277.425490]  __xfs_bunmapi+0x50d/0x840 [xfs]\n[ 4277.426445]  xfs_itruncate_extents_flags+0x13a/0x490 [xfs]\n[ 4277.427553]  xfs_inactive_truncate+0xa3/0x120 [xfs]\n[ 4277.428567]  xfs_inactive+0x22d/0x290 [xfs]\n[ 4277.429500]  xfs_inodegc_worker+0xb4/0x1a0 [xfs]\n[ 4277.430479]  process_one_work+0x171/0x340\n[ 4277.431227]  worker_thread+0x277/0x390\n[ 4277.431962]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n[ 4277.432752]  kthread+0xf0/0x120\n[ 4277.433382]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[ 4277.434134]  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n[ 4277.434837]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[ 4277.435566]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n[ 4277.436280]  </TASK> | linux-libc-dev |

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes\nidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a\nsimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is\nstill a spinlock.\n\nInstead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking\nhtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring\nthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map\npointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.\nTherefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these\nto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.\n\nThere are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr:\n\n(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIt invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of\nhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),\nbecause the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems.\nIt may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the\ninvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release\nthe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer\nof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and\nreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old\nelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old\nelement as well.\n\n(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIts caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),\nhtab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().\n\nFor htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after\nhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just\nlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list\nand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe\nto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these\nelements have been removed from the hash llist.\n\nBecause htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,\n__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept\nit as\n---truncated--- | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-56703 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix soft lockups in fib6_select_path under high next hop churn\n\nSoft lockups have been observed on a cluster of Linux-based edge routers\nlocated in a highly dynamic environment. Using the `bird` service, these\nrouters continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently\nchanging nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6\ntraffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath\ncircular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly\nwhile iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically\narises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted\nconcurrently on a different core—indicated by their 'next' and\n'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference\ncount dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a\nsoft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.\n\nApply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the\nissue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to\nannotate or use the RCU APIs.\n\nInclude a test script that reproduces the issue. The script\nperiodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load\nof outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients. It\nconsistently induces infinite soft lockups within a couple of minutes.\n\nKernel log:\n\n 0 [ffffbd13003e8d30] machine_kexec at ffffffff8ceaf3eb\n 1 [ffffbd13003e8d90] __crash_kexec at ffffffff8d0120e3\n 2 [ffffbd13003e8e58] panic at ffffffff8cef65d4\n 3 [ffffbd13003e8ed8] watchdog_timer_fn at ffffffff8d05cb03\n 4 [ffffbd13003e8f08] __hrtimer_run_queues at ffffffff8cfec62f\n 5 [ffffbd13003e8f70] hrtimer_interrupt at ffffffff8cfed756\n 6 [ffffbd13003e8fd0] __sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8cea01af\n 7 [ffffbd13003e8ff0] sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8df1b83d\n-- <IRQ stack> --\n 8 [ffffbd13003d3708] asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8e000ecb\n    [exception RIP: fib6_select_path+299]\n    RIP: ffffffff8ddafe7b  RSP: ffffbd13003d37b8  RFLAGS: 00000287\n    RAX: ffff975850b43600  RBX: ffff975850b40200  RCX: 0000000000000000\n    RDX: 000000003fffffff  RSI: 0000000051d383e4  RDI: ffff975850b43618\n    RBP: ffffbd13003d3800   R8: 0000000000000000   R9: ffff975850b40200\n    R10: 0000000000000000  R11: 0000000000000000  R12: ffffbd13003d3830\n    R13: ffff975850b436a8  R14: ffff975850b43600  R15: 0000000000000007\n    ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018\n 9 [ffffbd13003d3808] ip6_pol_route at ffffffff8ddb030c\n10 [ffffbd13003d3888] ip6_pol_route_input at ffffffff8ddb068c\n11 [ffffbd13003d3898] fib6_rule_lookup at ffffffff8ddf02b5\n12 [ffffbd13003d3928] ip6_route_input at ffffffff8ddb0f47\n13 [ffffbd13003d3a18] ip6_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd950d0\n14 [ffffbd13003d3a30] ip6_list_rcv_finish.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd96274\n15 [ffffbd13003d3a98] ip6_sublist_rcv at ffffffff8dd96474\n16 [ffffbd13003d3af8] ipv6_list_rcv at ffffffff8dd96615\n17 [ffffbd13003d3b60] __netif_receive_skb_list_core at ffffffff8dc16fec\n18 [ffffbd13003d3be0] netif_receive_skb_list_internal at ffffffff8dc176b3\n19 [ffffbd13003d3c50] napi_gro_receive at ffffffff8dc565b9\n20 [ffffbd13003d3c80] ice_receive_skb at ffffffffc087e4f5 [ice]\n21 [ffffbd13003d3c90] ice_clean_rx_irq at ffffffffc0881b80 [ice]\n22 [ffffbd13003d3d20] ice_napi_poll at ffffffffc088232f [ice]\n23 [ffffbd13003d3d80] __napi_poll at ffffffff8dc18000\n24 [ffffbd13003d3db8] net_rx_action at ffffffff8dc18581\n25 [ffffbd13003d3e40] __do_softirq at ffffffff8df352e9\n26 [ffffbd13003d3eb0] run_ksoftirqd at ffffffff8ceffe47\n27 [ffffbd13003d3ec0] smpboot_thread_fn at ffffffff8cf36a30\n28 [ffffbd13003d3ee8] kthread at ffffffff8cf2b39f\n29 [ffffbd13003d3f28] ret_from_fork at ffffffff8ce5fa64\n30 [ffffbd13003d3f50] ret_from_fork_asm at ffffffff8ce03cbb | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-56786 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: put bpf_link's program when link is safe to be deallocated\n\nIn general, BPF link's underlying BPF program should be considered to be\nreachable through attach hook -> link -> prog chain, and, pessimistically,\nwe have to assume that as long as link's memory is not safe to free,\nattach hook's code might hold a pointer to BPF program and use it.\n\nAs such, it's not (generally) correct to put link's program early before\nwaiting for RCU GPs to go through. More eager bpf_prog_put() that we\ncurrently do is mostly correct due to BPF program's release code doing\nsimilar RCU GP waiting, but as will be shown in the following patches,\nBPF program can be non-sleepable (and, thus, reliant on only "classic"\nRCU GP), while BPF link's attach hook can have sleepable semantics and\nneeds to be protected by RCU Tasks Trace, and for such cases BPF link\nhas to go through RCU Tasks Trace + "classic" RCU GPs before being\ndeallocated. And so, if we put BPF program early, we might free BPF\nprogram before we free BPF link, leading to use-after-free situation.\n\nSo, this patch defers bpf_prog_put() until we are ready to perform\nbpf_link's deallocation. At worst, this delays BPF program freeing by\none extra RCU GP, but that seems completely acceptable. Alternatively,\nwe'd need more elaborate ways to determine BPF hook, BPF link, and BPF\nprogram lifetimes, and how they relate to each other, which seems like\nan unnecessary complication.\n\nNote, for most BPF links we still will perform eager bpf_prog_put() and\nlink dealloc, so for those BPF links there are no observable changes\nwhatsoever. Only BPF links that use deferred dealloc might notice\nslightly delayed freeing of BPF programs.\n\nAlso, to reduce code and logic duplication, extract program put + link\ndealloc logic into bpf_link_dealloc() helper. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-57889 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: mcp23s08: Fix sleeping in atomic context due to regmap locking\n\nIf a device uses MCP23xxx IO expander to receive IRQs, the following\nbug can happen:\n\n  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context\n    at kernel/locking/mutex.c:283\n  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, ...\n  preempt_count: 1, expected: 0\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  ...\n  __might_resched+0x104/0x10e\n  __might_sleep+0x3e/0x62\n  mutex_lock+0x20/0x4c\n  regmap_lock_mutex+0x10/0x18\n  regmap_update_bits_base+0x2c/0x66\n  mcp23s08_irq_set_type+0x1ae/0x1d6\n  __irq_set_trigger+0x56/0x172\n  __setup_irq+0x1e6/0x646\n  request_threaded_irq+0xb6/0x160\n  ...\n\nWe observed the problem while experimenting with a touchscreen driver which\nused MCP23017 IO expander (I2C).\n\nThe regmap in the pinctrl-mcp23s08 driver uses a mutex for protection from\nconcurrent accesses, which is the default for regmaps without .fast_io,\n.disable_locking, etc.\n\nmcp23s08_irq_set_type() calls regmap_update_bits_base(), and the latter\nlocks the mutex.\n\nHowever, __setup_irq() locks desc->lock spinlock before calling these\nfunctions. As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding\nthe spinlock.\n\nIt seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.\nmcp->lock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,\nexcept, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.\n\nmcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under\nchip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes\nmcp->lock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C\naccesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().\n\nThe accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional\nlocking.\n\nIn all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except\nmcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp->lock.\n\nThis patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal\nlocking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping\nin atomic context described above. | linux-libc-dev |
| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-57890 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue\n\nIn the expression "cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count", both variables are u32\nvalues that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer\nwrapping.

The "cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)"\nmultiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on\n64bit systems.\n\nThis patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in\nuverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable "len" is on\none side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified\nall the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-57930 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Have process_string() also allow arrays\n\nIn order to catch a common bug where a TRACE_EVENT() TP_fast_assign()\nassigns an address of an allocated string to the ring buffer and then\nreferences it in TP_printk(), which can be executed hours later when the\nstring is free, the function test_event_printk() runs on all events as\nthey are registered to make sure there's no unwanted dereferencing.\n\nIt calls process_string() to handle cases in TP_printk() format that has\n"%s". It returns whether or not the string is safe. But it can have some\nfalse positives.\n\nFor instance, xe_bo_move() has:\n\n TP_printk("move_lacks_source:%s, migrate object %p [size %zu] from %s to %s device_id:%s",\n            __entry->move_lacks_source ?

This is an array of\npointers that should be safe for the event to access. Instead of flagging\nthis as a bad reference, if a reference points to an array, where the\nrecord field is the index, consider it safe. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2024-57945 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: mm: Fix the out of bound issue of vmemmap address\n\nIn sparse vmemmap model, the virtual address of vmemmap is calculated as:\n((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT)).\nAnd the struct page's va can be calculated with an offset:\n(vmemmap + (pfn)).\n\nHowever, when initializing struct pages, kernel actually starts from the\nfirst page from the same section that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the\nfirst page's physical address is not (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT), then\nwe get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it's struct page.\n\nFor example, if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000, the\nfirst page in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During\ninit_unavailable_range(), we will initialize struct page for pfn 0x80000\nwith virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000), which is\nbelow VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.\n\nThis commit fixes this bug by introducing a new variable\n'vmemmap_start_pfn' which is aligned with memory section size and using\nit to calculate vmemmap address instead of phys_ram_base. | linux-libc-dev |

To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 ("cpuset: break\nkernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()") added\n'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could\nlead to this warning.\n\nAfter the commit 2125c0034c5d ("cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug\nprocessing synchronous"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to\nwait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset\noperations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist\nanymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this\nwarning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the\n'cpuset_write_resmask'. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2025-21664 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\n\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() ->\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\n\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\n\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\n\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\n\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed. | linux-libc-dev |

There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)\nbut it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.\n\nThis case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory\npressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some\nfrequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an\nimx6q.\n\nSetting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve\nthe problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver\nignores the memory allocation error and can crash.\n\nThis commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet. | linux-libc-dev |

| MEDIUM | CVE-2025-21681 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nopenvswitch: fix lockup on tx to unregistering netdev with carrier\n\nCommit in a fixes tag attempted to fix the issue in the following\nsequence of calls:\n\n    do_output\n    -> ovs_vport_send\n       -> dev_queue_xmit\n          -> __dev_queue_xmit\n             -> netdev_core_pick_tx\n                -> skb_tx_hash\n\nWhen device is unregistering, the 'dev->real_num_tx_queues' goes to\nzero and the 'while (unlikely(hash >= qcount))' loop inside the\n'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.\n\nBut unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to\nfix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering\nstate while reporting carrier status OK.\n\nOne example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON\non start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.\nAnd it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.\nTherefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit\nthe infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There\nmight be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is\nimportant for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a\npacket sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the\nissue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.\n\nFix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running\nstate is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers\nunregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets\nto devices that are not running anyway.\n\nWhile only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier\ncheck is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined\nthroughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions\nlike __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit\na packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well. | linux-libc-dev |

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that "cat /etc/passwd" shows a rogue user account. | login |

When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share".

| LOW | CVE-2024-40918 | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Try to fix random segmentation faults in package builds\n\nPA-RISC systems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have had problems\nwith random segmentation faults for many years.  Systems with earlier\nprocessors are much more stable.\n\nSystems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have a large L2 cache which\nneeds per page flushing for decent performance when a large range is\nflushed. The combined cache in these systems is also more sensitive to\nnon-equivalent aliases than the caches in earlier systems.\n\nThe majority of random segmentation faults that I have looked at\nappear to be memory corruption in memory allocated using mmap and\nmalloc.\n\nMy first attempt at fixing the random faults didn't work. On\nreviewing the cache code, I realized that there were two issues\nwhich the existing code didn't handle correctly. Both relate\nto cache move-in. Another issue is that the present bit in PTEs\nis racy.\n\n1) PA-RISC caches have a mind of their own and they can speculatively\nload data and instructions for a page as long as there is a entry in\nthe TLB for the page which allows move-in. TLBs are local to each\nCPU. Thus, the TLB entry for a page must be purged before flushing\nthe page. This is particularly important on SMP systems.\n\nIn some of the flush routines, the flush routine would be called\nand then the TLB entry would be purged. This was because the flush\nroutine needed the TLB entry to do the flush.\n\n2) My initial approach to trying the fix the random faults was to\ntry and use flush_cache_page_if_present for all flush operations.\nThis actually made things worse and led to a couple of hardware\nlockups. It finally dawned on me that some lines weren't being\nflushed because the pte check code was racy. This resulted in\nrandom inequivalent mappings to physical pages.\n\nThe __flush_cache_page tmpalias flush sets up its own TLB entry\nand it doesn't need the existing TLB entry. As long as we can find\nthe pte pointer for the vm page, we can get the pfn and physical\naddress of the page. We can also purge the TLB entry for the page\nbefore doing the flush. Further, __flush_cache_page uses a special\nTLB entry that inhibits cache move-in.\n\nWhen switching page mappings, we need to ensure that lines are\nremoved from the cache.  It is not sufficient to just flush the\nlines to memory as they may come back.\n\nThis made it clear that we needed to implement all the required\nflush operations using tmpalias routines. This includes flushes\nfor user and kernel pages.\n\nAfter modifying the code to use tmpalias flushes, it became clear\nthat the random segmentation faults were not fully resolved. The\nfrequency of faults was worse on systems with a 64 MB L2 (PA8900)\nand systems with more CPUs (rp4440).\n\nThe warning that I added to flush_cache_page_if_present to detect\npages that couldn't be flushed triggered frequently on some systems.\n\nHelge and I looked at the pages that couldn't be flushed and found\nthat the PTE was either cleared or for a swap page. Ignoring pages\nthat were swapped out seemed okay but pages with cleared PTEs seemed\nproblematic.\n\nI looked at routines related to pte_clear and noticed ptep_clear_flush.\nThe default implementation just flushes the TLB entry. However, it was\nobvious that on parisc we need to flush the cache page as well. If\nwe don't flush the cache page, stale lines will be left in the cache\nand cause random corruption. Once a PTE is cleared, there is no way\nto find the physical address associated with the PTE and flush the\nassociated page at a later time.\n\nI implemented an updated change with a parisc specific version of\nptep_clear_flush. It fixed the random data corruption on Helge's rp4440\nand rp3440, as well as on my c8000.\n\nAt this point, I realized that I could restore the code where we only\nflush in flush_cache_page_if_present if the page has been accessed.\nHowever, for this, we also need to flush the cache when the accessed\nbit is cleared in\n---truncated--- | linux-libc-dev |
